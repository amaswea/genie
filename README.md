About Genie
------------
Genie is a Chrome Extension plugin that adds customized UIs on top of a web application to retarget inputs to new input modalities. Current prototype UIs add support for audio/voice commands, keyboard shortcuts, and command line commands. Contact amaswea@cs.washington.edu if you are interested in using Genie to build a new UI.
